  - [ ] View HTML source code
  - [ ] View cookie parameter
  - [ ] View HTTP headers

  **Metafiles**

  - [ ] View robots.txt
  - [ ] View sitemap.xml
  - [ ] View security.txt or .well-known/security.txt

- **CONFIGURATION & DEPLOYMENT MANAGEMENT TESTING**

  **Testing HTTP Methods**

- [ ]  Ensure the OPTIONS method is disabled
- [ ]  Test access control bypass
- [ ]  Test for XST attacks
- [ ]  Test for HTTP method overriding


- **IDENTITY MANAGEMENT TESTING**

  **Test Role Definitions**

  - [ ] Test for forced browsing
  - [ ] Test for IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
  - [ ] Test for parameter tampering
  - [ ] Ensure low privilege users arenâ€™t able to access high privilege resources

  **Testing For Account Enumeration**

  - [ ]  Check the response when a valid username and password entered
  - [ ]  Check the response when a valid username and an invalid password entered
  - [ ]  Check the response when an invalid username and password entered
  - [ ]  Ensure the rate-limiting functionality is enabled in username and password fields


- **AUTHENTICATION TESTING**

  **Test For Default Credentials**

  - [ ] Test with default credentials
  - [ ] Test organization name as credentials
  - [ ] Test for response manipulation
  - [ ] Test for the default username and a blank password
  - [ ] Review the page source for credentials

  **Test For Weak Password Policy**

  - [ ]  Ensure the password policy is set to strong
  - [ ]  Check for password reusability
  - [ ]  Check the user is prevented to use his username as a password
  - [ ]  Check for the usage of common weak passwords
  - [ ]  Check the minimum password length to be set
  - [ ]  Check the maximum password length to be set


- **AUTHORIZATION TESTING**
    
  **Testing Directory Traversal File Include**

  - [ ]  Identify the injection point on the URL
  - [ ]  Test for Local File Inclusion
  - [ ]  Test for Remote File Inclusion
  - [ ]  Test Traversal on the URL parameter
  - [ ]  Test Traversal on the cookie parameter

  **Testing Traversal With Encoding**

  - [ ]  Test Traversal with Double encoding
  - [ ]  Test Traversal with all characters encode
  - [ ]  Test Traversal with only special characters encode

  **Test For Privilege Escalation**

  - [ ]  Identify the injection point
  - [ ]  Test for bypassing the security measures
  - [ ]  Test for forced browsing
  - [ ]  Test for IDOR
  - [ ]  Test for parameter tampering to high privileged user

  **Test For Insecure Direct Object Reference**

  - [ ]  Test to change the ID parameter
  - [ ]  Test to add parameters at the endpoints
  - [ ]  Test for HTTP parameter pollution
  - [ ]  Test by adding an extension at the end
  - [ ]  Test with outdated API versions
  - [ ]  Test by wrapping the ID with an array
  - [ ]  Test by wrapping the ID with a JSON object
  - [ ]  Test for JSON parameter pollution
  - [ ]  Test by changing the case
  - [ ]  Test for path traversal
  - [ ]  Test by changing words
  - [ ]  Test by changing methods
